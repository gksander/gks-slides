# **Save your team some time.**

::gap

If spending 15 minutes planning makes your 30-minute meeting 25% more efficient for the 5 attendees, you can save:

$$
0.25 \cdot 30 \cdot 5 = 37.5\text{ minutes}
$$

::gap

You just saved you and your team $37.5 - 15 = 22.5$ minutes. And your meeting probably felt more organized and focused.

::gap{ size=lg }

### Over time, **that adds up.**

Savings increase as the duration of meeting and number of attendees increases. And maybe, eventually, your team will become _excited_ about meetings (or at least dread them less).

TL;DR: **spend a few minutes planning your meeting ahead of time.**
