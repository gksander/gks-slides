# Why TypeScript?

A *few* reasons why you might consider **TypeScript** over JavaScript.

&nbsp;


```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
import { Bar } from "victory";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Bar d />
//        ^|
  )
}

```

# Catch Operation Mistakes

With JS, you might walk right into unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

```js
const fruits = new Set(["apples", "bananas"]);
const numFruits = fruits.length;
````

With **TypeScript**, catch these mistakes during development.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2339

const fruits = new Set(["apples", "bananas"]);
const numFruits = fruits.length;
```

---

# Stronger Function Definitions

With JS, you might need additional runtime checks for function argument types.

```js twoslash
const countItems = (items) => {

}
```

With **TypeScript**, push these checks to the type system.

```ts twoslash

```

# Better Function Calls

With JS, you might not know if you're improperly calling a function until runtime.

```js twoslash
const shout = ({ message }) => {/*...*/};

shout("HELLO!");
```

With **TypeScript**, catch these mistakes during development.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 7031 2345
const shout = ({ message }: { message: string }) => {/*...*/};

shout("HELLO!");
```
