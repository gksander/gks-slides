# Utility Types in TypeScript

**TypeScript** offers some very useful utility types to help you wrangle types like a real type-cowboy, such as:

- `Awaited`
- `Omit`
- `Pick`
- `NonNullable`
- `ReturnType`
- `Parameters`
- `Partial`
- `Required`
- `Exclude`
- `Extract`

## Let's take a peak! ðŸ‘‰

# The `Awaited` type

Use this utility type to unwrap promises.

```ts twoslash
const getName = Promise.resolve("Roger" as const);

type PromValue = Awaited<typeof getName>;
//   ^?
```

Shoot, use it with recursive promises, too.

```ts twoslash
const getName = Promise
	.resolve("Roger" as const)
	.then(name => `Hello, ${name}` as const);

type PromValue = Awaited<typeof getName>;
//   ^?
```

---

# The `Omit` type

Ditch some keys from a type to "broaden" a type.

```ts twoslash
type Person = { name: string; age: number; height: number; }
type AgelessPerson = Omit<Person, 'age'>;
//   ^?
```

Use string union to omit multiple keys.

```ts twoslash
type Person = { name: string; age: number; height: number; }
// ---cut---
type NameOnlyPerson = Omit<Person, 'age' | 'height'>;
//   ^?
```

---

# The `Pick` type

Kind of like `Omit`, but we select specific keys to *keep* (instead of to discard).

```ts twoslash
type Person = { name: string; age: number; height: number; }
type NameOnlyPerson = Pick<Person, 'name'>;
//   ^?

// Use string union to pick multiple keys.
type NameAndAge = Pick<Person, 'name' | 'age'>;
//   ^?
```

---

# The `NonNullable` type

Remove `null` and `undefined` from your type.

Handy if you'd like to derive a new type by stripping out `null` and `undefined` from a type that you already have.

```ts twoslash
// Maybe our API response has a nullable value
type ApiResponse = { name: string; age: string; } | null;

// But we want to use the non-null part as a type
type Person = NonNullable<ApiResponse>;
//   ^?
```

---

# The `ReturnType` type

Get the type of the return value of a function type. Very useful for deriving types from functions you already have sitting around.

```ts twoslash
import { useState } from "react";

type UseStateReturn = ReturnType<typeof useState>;
//   ^?
```
