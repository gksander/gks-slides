- Intro: vectors and matrices used to represent points and transformations in 2 and 3d space

# Introduction

In mathematics, we often use **vectors** to represent points in 2D and 3D space.

A vector looks something like this:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We then use **matrices** and **matrix multiplication** to apply transformations to our points in 2D/3D space.

A matrix looks something like this:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \alpha & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \alpha
\end{bmatrix}
$$

# Vectors to represent points in space

TODO: Vector used to represent point in space. Can use 2D to represent x/y position.

---

# Use 3D vectors for points in 2D space

TODO: Useful transformations in 2D space require 3D transformations, so we use 3d vectors with z value of 0.

# Use matrices to represent "linear" transformations

TODO: Use matrices to represent a "linear transformation". Multiply matrix by vector to apply transformation to point.
